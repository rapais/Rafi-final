            Yo rapi, Happy birthday!
          </p>
          <p>
            If someone ask me, who's one of the few person that I am glad they spend the year with me. You're one of them
            I really really really feel blessed that i get to go through this year with you. Ever since we met at 9th grade
            I never had a boring day. I really want to know you better. and before we know it, you already became my closest friends.
          </p>

            Happy happy happy birthday my guy, u already hit 20 sheesh. cie tua hahahaha. lo salah satu temen gue yg gue percaya dan gue nyaman buat cerita hal2 buruk gue.
            I wont even trade u for something else man. meskipun gue tau, gue sering bgt ngilang pas lo butuh gue. tp pas kita punya waktu buat ngobrol, we still as close
            as ever and it makes me happy. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Makasih ya udah kuat sampe sekarang. I know that you always tries to do your best. Trying to radiate that positive vibes to everyone you met, 
            telling jokes to break the ice, showing the stong figure to make the whole team feel safe. Great work pi, I'm proud of you. To be able to 
            go through all of it, day by day, and make your way to be here with everyone. You're a legend.
